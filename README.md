# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website solution

This is a solution to the [Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

That was my fist react project!
Its is responsive for mobile(375px), tablet(530px - 768px) and desktop(1100px - 1440px)
It also has some animations(check it out).

Obs: If you're using Firefox, you should see some bugs at the navigation bar. That's because Firefox does not have the backdrop-filter property full implemented yet. Therefore, it's disabled by default but you can enable it. But even then it wouldn't show all the effects.
